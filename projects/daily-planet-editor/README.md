Project Requirements

Passing Criteria: Code Review

Your project must pass a code review with the instructor or TA. They will specifically be looking for fixes to the things mentioned in the bullets listed above (correct usage of variables, operators, spelling, JavaScript code style, etc.), but you're welcome to do as much beneficial refactoring as you think is good. (Remember not to go overboard, or you could add too much complexity to the program).
